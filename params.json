Note that this statement does _not_ reflect __in any way, shape or form__ the licenses of the packages therein.  Each package has its own associated license and you are bound by the terms of each you download and/or use.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Using this conda repo channel\r\n\r\n#### Adding the channel to your conda config\r\n\r\n1. run `conda config --add channels http://xguse.github.io/conda-package-repo/pkgs/channel/` to prepend the repo to your channel list.\r\n2. if you get an error complaining that the yaml file can not be parsed, you have two options:  \r\n    a. open the file in your favorite text editor and add the channel URL to the YAML list named 'channels'\r\n\r\n    ```YAML\r\n    channels:\r\n      - http://xguse.github.io/conda-package-repo/pkgs/channel/\r\n      - defaults\r\n    ```  \r\n\r\n    b. run `conda config -f --add channels http://xguse.github.io/conda-package-repo/pkgs/channel/` which will remove the incorrect formatting and any comments present, then add the channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Searching for packages on this channel specifically\r\n\r\nTo search for the `bowtie2` package specifically within this and __only this__ channel:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nconda search -c http://xguse.github.io/conda-package-repo/pkgs/channel/ --override-channels bowtie2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Repo packages\r\n\r\nMost packages will exist only for 64 bit linux because that is what I generally use.\r\nBut if you know me and I like you, feel free to request a specific build architecture.\r\nIf I can accommodate you, I will.\r\n\r\nHere are the files hosted for various architectures:\r\n\r\n- [linux-32](pkgs/channel/linux-32)\r\n- [linux-64](pkgs/channel/linux-64)\r\n- [osx-64](pkgs/channel/osx-64)\r\n- [win-32](pkgs/channel/win-32)\r\n- [win-64](pkgs/channel/win-64)\r\n","google":"UA-39898476-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
